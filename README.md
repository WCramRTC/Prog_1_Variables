# C# Primitive Data Types

C# includes several primitive data types, which are the basic data types that are built into the language. Here's a brief overview of the main ones:

## Numeric Types

1. **int**: Represents 32-bit integers. Used for whole numbers.
2. **long**: Represents 64-bit integers. Used for larger whole numbers.
3. **float**: Represents 32-bit floating-point numbers. Used for decimal numbers with less precision.
4. **double**: Represents 64-bit floating-point numbers. Used for decimal numbers with more precision.
5. **decimal**: Represents 128-bit precise decimal numbers. Used for financial and monetary calculations.

## Boolean Type

- **bool**: Represents a Boolean value, which can be either `true` or `false`.

## Character Type

- **char**: Represents a single 16-bit Unicode character.

## Text Type

- **string**: Represents a sequence of characters. Unlike the other primitive types, `string` is a reference type.

These data types are fundamental to C# programming and are used to define the type of variables which can store data in various formats.
